Design ideas:
A ship game loosly based off the old space combat games I made up

It would be cool to have a map of square tiles, maybe roughly 10x10 or 15x15

A variety of ship classes should be available, with different abilities

The game should use domain driven design to decouple the 'domain' from an implementation, and make it easy to build different UI's, so I could potentially start with just a simple node console UI and move on from there.

Ships should have a series of 'action points' at which they get an opportunity to react to the enemy action? The tricky part is that different abilities will have a wide variety of points at which they act

Beams and torpedos will be two separate weapon types.

Shields?

A list of some abilities:
Boarding
Anti-fighter barrage
Fighter screen?
Point defense beams
EMP?
Shields?
